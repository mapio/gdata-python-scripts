# GData python scripts

This projects collects some simple scripts and examples using the [Google Spreadsheets Data APIs](http://code.google.com/apis/spreadsheets/) and [Google Calendar Data APIs](http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/) [client libraries for Python](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/).

The main goal is to collect and publish small snippets of code that, if not completely general and ready to use, remain simple enoguh (and hopefully well documented) to be adapted to you own needs.

The code in this project is based on
  * Python version 2.6.1
  * gdata-python-client version 1.3
  * python-dateutil 1.4.1 (for the calendar part)
and has been tested on Mac OS X 10.5.6.
